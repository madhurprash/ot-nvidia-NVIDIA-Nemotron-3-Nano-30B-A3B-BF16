SYSTEM PROMPT
================================================================================

You are an autonomous agent executing tasks in a sandboxed environment. Follow these instructions carefully.

## WORKING DIRECTORY & ENVIRONMENT CONTEXT

Your current working directory is:
bash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
/app/personal-site

Files in current directory (showing first 10 of 17):
1. bash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device
2. bash: no job control in this shell
3. CNAME
4. Gemfile
5. _config.yml
6. _includes
7. _layouts
8. _posters
9. _publications
10. biblib

**IMPORTANT**: This directory information is provided for your convenience at the start of the task. You should:
- Use this information to understand the initial environment state
- Avoid redundantly calling `ls` or similar commands just to list the same directory
- Only use file listing commands if you need updated information (after creating/deleting files) or need to explore subdirectories
- Work in the /app directory unless explicitly instructed otherwise

## Core Guidelines:
1. **Action-Oriented**: Focus on executing commands to complete the task rather than providing explanations
2. **Iterative Problem-Solving**: Break down complex tasks into manageable steps
3. **Command Execution**: ALWAYS provide bash commands in ```bash code blocks for execution
4. **Result Analysis**: Carefully analyze command outputs to determine next steps
5. **Error Handling**: If a command fails, analyze the error and adapt your approach
6. **Task Completion**: When the task is fully complete, explicitly state "TASK COMPLETE"

## Best Practices:
- Use clear, well-formed bash commands
- Install any required dependencies as needed
- Verify command outputs before proceeding
- Track your progress towards task completion
- Be concise and direct in your responses

## CRITICAL: Avoid Verification Loops
**DO NOT get stuck repeating the same verification commands:**
- Once you verify a file exists or contains correct content, move forward to the next step
- Do NOT repeatedly check the same thing (e.g., `cat file.txt` 100+ times)
- If you've verified something works, trust that result and proceed
- Keep mental track of what you've already checked to avoid redundant verification
- If a verification passes, that step is DONE - move to the next task requirement

## Task Completion Recognition:
- Complete the given task following the instructions precisely
- Once you've created/verified all required outputs, immediately say "TASK COMPLETE"
- Do NOT keep verifying after the task is done
- Trust your verification results - if the output matches requirements, you're finished
- Do not provide unnecessary explanations unless specifically asked

Remember: Your goal is to complete the task efficiently through terminal commands.

============================================================
ITERATION 1
============================================================

[ASSISTANT RESPONSE]
Let me help you find and merge your changes into master. First, let's check the git status to see what branch you're on and what changes exist:[TOOL_CALLS]bashgit status


============================================================
ITERATION 2
============================================================

[ASSISTANT RESPONSE]
```bash
cd /app/personal-site && git status
```


============================================================
ITERATION 3
============================================================

[ASSISTANT RESPONSE]
```bash
git log --oneline -10
```

Let me check recent commits to see if your changes might be in a different commit or branch.


============================================================
ITERATION 4
============================================================

[ASSISTANT RESPONSE]
```bash
git branch -a
```

Let me check if there are any other branches that might contain your changes.


============================================================
ITERATION 5
============================================================

[ASSISTANT RESPONSE]
```bash
git reflog
```

Let me check the git reflog to see if there's any record of your recent changes that might have been lost during checkout.


============================================================
ITERATION 6
============================================================

[ASSISTANT RESPONSE]
```bash
git show 650dba4
```

I found your uncommitted changes! The reflog shows you had a commit "Move to Stanford" (650dba4) that was lost when you checked out master. Let me see what those changes were.


============================================================
ITERATION 7
============================================================

[ASSISTANT RESPONSE]
```bash
git cherry-pick 650dba4
```

Perfect! I found your changes. They were in commit 650dba4 titled "Move to Stanford". Now I'll merge those changes into master using cherry-pick.


============================================================
ITERATION 8
============================================================

[ASSISTANT RESPONSE]
```bash
git status
```

There's a merge conflict in the about.md file. Let me check the status to see what needs to be resolved.


============================================================
ITERATION 9
============================================================

[ASSISTANT RESPONSE]
```bash
cat _includes/about.md
```

Let me view the conflicted file to see what needs to be resolved.


============================================================
ITERATION 10
============================================================

[ASSISTANT RESPONSE]
```bash
cat > _includes/about.md << 'EOF'
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Stanford CS.

Previously, I was a Student Researcher at [Google Research](https://research.google/), an ML Research Intern at [Apple Health AI](https://machinelearning.apple.com/work-with-us) and a data scientist and the second full-time employee at [HealthRhythms](https://www.healthrhythms.com).

My research interests include designing machine learning systems that improve human health and well-being. My work spans algorithmic fairness, causal inference, and natural language processing.

You can contact me at mike@mikemerrill.org

```

Now let me resolve the conflict by keeping the new version from your commit (Stanford affiliation).


============================================================
ITERATION 11
============================================================

[ASSISTANT RESPONSE]
```bash
git add _includes/about.md
```

Good! I've resolved the conflict by keeping your Stanford changes. Now let me stage the resolved file and continue the cherry-pick.


============================================================
ITERATION 12
============================================================

[ASSISTANT RESPONSE]
```bash
git cherry-pick --continue
```

Now let me continue with the cherry-pick to complete merging your changes into master.


============================================================
ITERATION 13
============================================================

[ASSISTANT RESPONSE]
```bash
git log --oneline -5
```

Excellent! The cherry-pick succeeded and your "Move to Stanford" commit has been merged into master. Let me verify the latest commits to confirm everything is in order.


============================================================
ITERATION 14
============================================================

[ASSISTANT RESPONSE]
```bash
git diff 68eab4f^..68eab4f _includes/about.md
```

Let me verify that your changes were properly applied by showing the differences in the about.md file.


============================================================
ITERATION 15
============================================================

[ASSISTANT RESPONSE]
```bash
cat _includes/about.md
```

Let me verify the final content of the about.md file to ensure your changes are properly reflected.


============================================================
ITERATION 16
============================================================

[ASSISTANT RESPONSE]
Perfect! Your changes have been successfully merged into master. The about.md file now shows:

1. ✅ Updated affiliation from UW PhD candidate to Stanford Postdoctoral Researcher
2. ✅ Added research interests section
3. ✅ Added contact information
4. ✅ Removed the "looking for a job" message

The commit "Move to Stanford" (68eab4f) is now part of the master branch history.
