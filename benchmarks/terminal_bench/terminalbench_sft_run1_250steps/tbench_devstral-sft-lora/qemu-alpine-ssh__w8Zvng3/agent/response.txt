SYSTEM PROMPT
================================================================================

You are an autonomous agent executing tasks in a sandboxed environment. Follow these instructions carefully.

## WORKING DIRECTORY & ENVIRONMENT CONTEXT

Your current working directory is:
bash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
/app

Files in current directory (4 files):
1. bash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device
2. bash: no job control in this shell
3. alpine-disk.qcow2
4. alpine.iso

**IMPORTANT**: This directory information is provided for your convenience at the start of the task. You should:
- Use this information to understand the initial environment state
- Avoid redundantly calling `ls` or similar commands just to list the same directory
- Only use file listing commands if you need updated information (after creating/deleting files) or need to explore subdirectories
- Work in the /app directory unless explicitly instructed otherwise

## Core Guidelines:
1. **Action-Oriented**: Focus on executing commands to complete the task rather than providing explanations
2. **Iterative Problem-Solving**: Break down complex tasks into manageable steps
3. **Command Execution**: ALWAYS provide bash commands in ```bash code blocks for execution
4. **Result Analysis**: Carefully analyze command outputs to determine next steps
5. **Error Handling**: If a command fails, analyze the error and adapt your approach
6. **Task Completion**: When the task is fully complete, explicitly state "TASK COMPLETE"

## Best Practices:
- Use clear, well-formed bash commands
- Install any required dependencies as needed
- Verify command outputs before proceeding
- Track your progress towards task completion
- Be concise and direct in your responses

## CRITICAL: Avoid Verification Loops
**DO NOT get stuck repeating the same verification commands:**
- Once you verify a file exists or contains correct content, move forward to the next step
- Do NOT repeatedly check the same thing (e.g., `cat file.txt` 100+ times)
- If you've verified something works, trust that result and proceed
- Keep mental track of what you've already checked to avoid redundant verification
- If a verification passes, that step is DONE - move to the next task requirement

## Task Completion Recognition:
- Complete the given task following the instructions precisely
- Once you've created/verified all required outputs, immediately say "TASK COMPLETE"
- Do NOT keep verifying after the task is done
- Trust your verification results - if the output matches requirements, you're finished
- Do not provide unnecessary explanations unless specifically asked

Remember: Your goal is to complete the task efficiently through terminal commands.

TASK INSTRUCTION
================================================================================

Start the /app/alpine.iso image in qemu, and then start an ssh server on the alpine linux vm. When you're done, I should be able to run `ssh -p 2222 root@localhost` with password `password123` and be dropped into a shell. On the /app/alpine.iso image, the default username is root with no password.

ITERATION 1
============================================================

[ASSISTANT RESPONSE]
I'll start by launching the Alpine Linux ISO in QEMU with SSH access configured. Let me begin by examining the current environment and then setting up the VM.[TOOL_CALLS]bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom /app/alpine.iso -m 512M -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 -device virtio-net,netdev=net0 -nographic -serial mon:stdio
```

[ASSISTANT RESPONSE]
```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom /app/alpine.iso -m 512M -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 -device virtio-net,netdev=net0 -nographic -serial mon:stdio
