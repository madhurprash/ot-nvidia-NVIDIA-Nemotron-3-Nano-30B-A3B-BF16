SYSTEM PROMPT

You are an autonomous agent executing tasks in a sandboxed environment. Follow these instructions carefully.

## WORKING DIRECTORY & ENVIRONMENT CONTEXT

Your current working directory is:
bash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
/app

Files in current directory (3 files):
1. bash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device
2. bash: no job control in this shell
3. text.gcode

**IMPORTANT**: This directory information is provided for your convenience at the start of the task. You should:
- Use this information to understand the initial environment state
- Avoid redundantly calling `ls` or similar commands just to list the same directory
- Only use file listing commands if you need updated information (after creating/deleting files) or need to explore subdirectories
- Work in the /app directory unless explicitly instructed otherwise

## Core Guidelines:
1. **Action-Oriented**: Focus on executing commands to complete the task rather than providing explanations
2. **Iterative Problem-Solving**: Break down complex tasks into manageable steps
3. **Command Execution**: ALWAYS provide bash commands in ```bash code blocks for execution
4. **Result Analysis**: Carefully analyze command outputs to determine next steps
5. **Error Handling**: If a command fails, analyze the error and adapt your approach
6. **Task Completion**: When the task is fully complete, explicitly state "TASK COMPLETE"

## Best Practices:
- Use clear, well-formed bash commands
- Install any required dependencies as needed
- Verify command outputs before proceeding
- Track your progress towards task completion
- Be concise and direct in your responses

## CRITICAL: Avoid Verification Loops
**DO NOT get stuck repeating the same verification commands:**
- Once you verify a file exists or contains correct content, move forward to the next step
- Do NOT repeatedly check the same thing (e.g., `cat file.txt` 100+ times)
- If you've verified something works, trust that result and proceed
- Keep mental track of what you've already checked to avoid redundant verification
- If a verification passes, that step is DONE - move to the next task requirement

## Task Completion Recognition:
- Complete the given task following the instructions precisely
- Once you've created/verified all required outputs, immediately say "TASK COMPLETE"
- Do NOT keep verifying after the task is done
- Trust your verification results - if the output matches requirements, you're finished
- Do not provide unnecessary explanations unless specifically asked

Remember: Your goal is to complete the task efficiently through terminal commands.

TASK INSTRUCTION
================================================================================

I have provided a file called text.gcode. This is a gcode file for a Prusa MK4s. I'm trying to print some text onto an existing object. When I run the print, what will the text show? Write the output to /app/out.txt

[ASSISTANT RESPONSE]
```bash
# Extract the text from the GCODE file by looking for lines containing G1 X Y E commands
# These lines represent movements with extrusion, which would create visible lines
grep -E '^G1.*F[0-9]+' text.gcode | head -n 1 > out.txt
